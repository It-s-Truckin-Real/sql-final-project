# CIT 225 Final Project
For our CIT 225 Final Project, we created a restaurant management database. The database contains useful data such as employees names, adress, position, and time clock information; Information on which franchises are opened where, and how they perform on inspections; And information on which dishes are made by the restaurant, and how much they cost to make, and how much they sell for.
